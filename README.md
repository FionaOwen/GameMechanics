### Description

<p align="justify">
Deep in the cosmos, the Galaxy of Aquarius symbolises hope, protecting the remains of planet Earthâ€™s once vast oceans.  In this post-apocalyptic universe, humanity and sea life have adapted to an existence among the stars.  The lakes and oceans of planet Earth, once teeming with life, have now vanished, leaving only fragments of their former glory. These fragments, transformed into cosmic orbs floating through space, represent the last reserves of water. They are essential for the survival of both humans and aquatic life in the vast expanse of space. 

<p align="justify">
You are a cosmic voyager, part of a specialised group responsible for the collection of water orbs. Your mission is vital for the survival of humanity.
<p align="justify">
The spacecraft you are travelling on is heading to Space Station M331 where your mission is to collect as many blue (pure water) orbs as possible within a 3-minute timeframe.
 
You can catch
 
Blue orbs: 
These are essential for human survival and earn 10 points each.
 
Aqua orbs: 
These are essential for aquatic life and will cost you 5 points for each 
 
And
Orange orbs: 
These are contaminated and hazardous for all life forms and will cost you 15 points 
<p align="justify"> 
You must also eliminate one-eyed alien creatures that emerge from contaminated orange orbs, each elimination scores 1 point. 
If they are left to attack they will circulate and reduce your score: each complete circulation by a creature results in a 5 point penalty.

<p align="justify">
Focus on collecting blue orbs, carefully balancing the necessity of securing water against the risk of engaging with alien creatures.
Develop a strategy to maximise points while avoiding the selection of orange orbs, which contaminate water supplies, and aqua-coloured orbs, to preserve the aquatic ecosystem. 
 
The game ends with a display of your score that reflects your choices.

#### Bouncing Orbs with Gravity Gun Interaction

<p align="justify">
The game's physics mechanics are enhanced by the inclusion of the gravity gun and ray interactor. The gravity gun allows the player to alter the orbsâ€™ natural trajectory by manipulating their movement through attraction. This functionality not only adds a strategic dimension to the gameplay but also challenges players to predict the orbsâ€™ natural bounce.The ray interactor serves as a visual guide, helping players gauge the direction and potential impact of their manoeuvres. This combination of the gameâ€™s physics and interactions mechanics, creates a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience. It encourages players to master the mechanics to achieve high scores and successfully complete the mission.

#### Bursting Orb and Alien Creature
<img src="https://github.com/FionaOwen/Pictures/blob/main/GameMechanics02.png" width="1100" height="" />
<p align="justify">
A key moment in the gameâ€™s mechanics is captured: the bursting of a contaminated orange orb and the subsequent release of an alien creature. This is a key challenge in the game's narrative and design, requiring players to use the gravity gun with precision and strategic insight.  The necessity to quickly eliminate the alien creature adds a significant layer of complexity and urgency to the gameplay, emphasising the game's focus on quick decision-making under pressure. The realistic water effects that accompany the orb's burst enhance the visual impact and immersion of this event. Furthermore, the emergence of the alien creature introduces a new dimension to the orb collection challenge, underscoring the game's underlying theme of cause and effect. Each player action has direct and significant consequences, heightening the stakes and intensifying the gameplay experience.  This illustrates where the player choices significantly influence the outcome and progress within the game.
